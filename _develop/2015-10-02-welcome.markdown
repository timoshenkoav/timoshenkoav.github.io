Having a lot of fun with work, i always store list of my achievements and new topics i am interested in **Evernote** as a list, and information about them as notes. After almost a year using this technique i realized that is not so good way. Thats why i've created this blog on **GitHub Pages** to check if its convenient for me to write articles (and as additional way to get some level up, as i haven't wrote articles describing by life/work before) about my thoughts/work etc. 

Main purpose of this is to describe some technical things i learn,faced up while developing Android/RoR applications. But sometimes i will also post something about living in Montenegro. 

Lets have a fun!
